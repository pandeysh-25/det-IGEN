# Det-IGEN: Detectable Watermarking in Image Generation


In this project, we present Det-IGEN (Detectable Watermarking for Image GENeration).

Det-IGEN addresses the challenge of accurately detecting AI-generated images, by proposing a novel watermarking technique integrated directly into the generation process of diffusion models. Our method embeds a unique, noise-based signature within the model, which generates images that contain frequency-based watermarks. The watermark is designed to be resilient against common image manipulations while maintaining the visual quality of the generated images.

## Generation/Detection Pipeline

The overall Det-IGEN pipeline, covering both the image generation and detection techniques, is shown in the image below.
